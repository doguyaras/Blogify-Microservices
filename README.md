# Blogify-Microservices
Blogify Microservices Architecture

In this project, I have been working on transforming my existing Blogify Project into a microservices architecture. 
I have separated users, articles, and comments into different services. I have also separated the naming, that is, the Eureka server, and additionally created an API gateway. 
I have connected all these services to Eureka.

Technologies I have used: 

-Spring Boot 
-Spring Cloud 
-Flyway 
-Docker 
-Eureka 
-Zipkin

Note: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED YET.
